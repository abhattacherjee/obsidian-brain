"""vault_doctor check: legacy snapshot migration.

Runs FOUR ordered checks that bring pre-spec snapshots into the new
first-class format:

  1. snapshot-legacy-filename       — add -HHMMSS derived from mtime
  2. snapshot-missing-status         — add status: auto-logged or summarized
  3. snapshot-missing-backlink       — write source_session_note wikilink
  4. session-missing-snapshots-list  — backfill snapshots: list on sessions

All are idempotent. The filename rename also rewrites vault-wide
[[<old-stem>]] wikilinks so decisions/insights that pointed at legacy
filenames still resolve after migration.
