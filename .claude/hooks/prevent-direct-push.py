    an unwritable decision channel silently turns this gate off. Measured with
    fd 1 closed: all five hooks exited 0 with zero bytes on stdout and zero on
    stderr — no traceback, no warning, command permitted.

    Two mechanics make that reachable rather than theoretical:

    * ``print()`` is a documented NO-OP when ``sys.stdout`` is ``None``, which
      is what CPython sets it to when fd 1 is closed. It does not raise.
    * ``print()`` BUFFERS. Against a pipe whose reader has gone away, the write
      lands at interpreter shutdown — after ``sys.exit(0)`` has already fixed
      the exit code — where ``BrokenPipeError`` is reported as "Exception
      ignored" and changes nothing. Hence the explicit ``flush()`` INSIDE the
      try: it drags that failure back to a point where it can still be acted
      on.

    The fallback is exit 2, the one blocking signal that needs no stdout —
    with ``sys.stdout`` dropped first, or CPython's finalization re-flush fails
    and overrides the status with 120 (measured), which is non-blocking. The
    reason goes to stderr via ``sys.stderr.write`` guarded on truthiness, NOT
    ``print(..., file=sys.stderr)`` — with fd 2 closed ``sys.stderr`` is
    ``None`` and ``print(file=None)`` falls back to STDOUT, which would put a

    parse error (note_writer's overflow-detection idiom, extended here to the
    .claude/hooks/ gates). Everything that can go wrong denies, because a gate
    that cannot read its input has not established that the command is safe —
    and every uncaught alternative is fail-OPEN, since an exception exits
    non-zero and a non-zero exit is a NON-blocking error under the PreToolUse
    contract.

    Four failure modes, each measured against these scripts:

    * the READ itself, caught as broadly as the parse. Invalid UTF-8 raises
      ``UnicodeDecodeError`` before ``json.loads`` is ever reached, so the
      read has to be inside a ``try`` at all — but a narrow
      ``(UnicodeDecodeError, OSError)`` is not enough either: with fd 0
      closed, CPython sets ``sys.stdin`` to ``None``, so the failure is an
      ``AttributeError`` on the attribute access and never reaches ``read()``,
      and a closed file object raises ``ValueError``, which is not an
      ``OSError``. Measured: all five hooks exited 1 on ``<&-``.
    * the PARSE. ``json.JSONDecodeError`` is not all ``json.loads`` raises:
      ~400 KB of nested ``[`` — comfortably under the cap — raises
      ``RecursionError``, which is not a ``ValueError``. Hence bare
      ``except Exception``.
    * the SHAPE. ``null``, ``[]``, ``5``, ``"5"`` and ``true`` all parse
      cleanly and then blow up on ``.get()`` in the caller.
    * the NESTED shape. See ``_payload_shape_ok``.

    The guarantee has a floor, and it is the interpreter, not this function:
    fail-closed holds from the hook's first statement onward. Hand the process
    a DIRECTORY as stdin and CPython aborts in ``init_sys_streams`` ("<stdin>
    is a directory, cannot continue") before any of this code runs — exit 1,
    which is non-blocking, and nothing in the script can intervene.

    ``state`` is one of:

    * ``"exec"`` — the position is in the command stream. A command written
      here runs here, and a ``cd`` written here moves this shell.
    * ``"quoted"`` — inside `'...'` or `"..."`, including a quote this prefix
      never closes. The text is data: a ``cd`` here is not a ``cd`` and a verb
      here is not a command.

    * ``"broken"`` — ``prefix`` does not parse (an unbalanced ``)``). Nothing

    ``subshells`` is the tuple of start offsets of the plain ``( )`` subshells

def _at_command_position(prefix: str) -> bool:
    """True when a word starting at the end of ``prefix`` is a COMMAND.

    ``echo git push origin main`` is not a push, it is an argument — but a
    gate that matches its verb as text denies it anyway, and that false deny
    blocked this project's own tooling repeatedly (#327). A verb is a command
    at the start of the line, or straight after a separator.

    Walking back over TRANSPARENT tokens is what keeps the forms that really
    do run the verb on the gated side. Three groups, and every one of them was
    measured denying on ``develop`` and allowing here before it was added:

    * block openers and shell keywords — ``if <verb>; then …``,
      ``while``/``until``, ``then``/``else``/``do``/``elif``, ``!``;
    * exec wrappers — ``sudo``, ``env``, ``command``, ``builtin``, ``exec``,
      ``nohup``, ``nice``, ``time``, ``timeout``, ``xargs``, ``eval``,
      ``stdbuf``, and ``VAR=value`` assignments;
    * a bare backslash — ``\\git push …`` is the ordinary way to bypass an
      alias or a function of the same name, and the verb pattern matches at
      offset 1, leaving the escape as its own token here.

    An OPTION (``-n1``) is transparent too: it belongs to whatever precedes
    it, and that word decides. So ``echo -n git push …`` walks past ``-n``,
    reaches ``echo``, and is correctly read as text — and ``xargs -n1 git …``
    walks the same ``-n1``, reaches ``xargs``, and is gated.

    A BARE word is the hard case, because it is what a wrapper's separated
    argument looks like (``timeout 60 git push …``, ``nice -n 10 git push …``)
    AND what a command taking the verb as data looks like (``echo git push
    …``). The two are told apart by what is further left: bare words are
    carried, and count as absorbed only once an ``_ARG_TAKING_TOKENS`` wrapper
    is reached. Hit the start of the command, a separator, or a plain keyword
    with bare words still outstanding and they were arguments to something
    that is NOT a wrapper — so the verb is that thing's data, and this returns
    False.

    The walk gives up after ``_WALK_STEP_LIMIT`` words, on the gated side.
    That bound is about COST, not meaning: each step rescans the text to its
    left, so an unbounded walk is quadratic in a command line an attacker
    writes. A carry limit was tried first and proved unfalsifiable — the
    terminal check already rejects ``echo one two three four <verb>``, so
    raising the limit changed no verdict a test could see.

    Two known limits, both in the fail-open direction:

    * A verb inside a string a shell later executes (``eval "<verb>"``,
      ``bash -c "<verb>"``) is "quoted" and is dropped. That is deliberate —
      the alternative is treating every quoted mention of the verb as a
      command, which is the false deny this exists to close.
    * A QUOTED executable is not matched at all: ``"git" push …`` and
      ``g"i"t push …`` allow, here and on develop alike. Recognising them
      means joining shell words before matching, i.e. a real parser rather
      than a scanner, so the gap is documented rather than half-closed.

    """Check if the command targets a repo within this project.

    Hooks run in their own process (cwd = project dir), so the git state the
    hook inspects is the wrong repo's when Claude does 'cd /other/repo && ...'.
    Parse the cd targets from the command to determine the effective repo.

    ``verb`` is the regex the caller already matched to decide this command is
    worth gating. It is used as a PATTERN, not a literal: a caller that
    interpolates anything into it — a path, a branch name — must wrap that in
    ``re.escape()``, or the positions computed here silently shift and the
    scoping decision is made about the wrong offsets. It must be the SAME
    pattern the caller matched, and it is applied through the same
    ``_verb_occurrences()``, so the two cannot disagree about where the verb is.

    Only a ``cd`` that PRECEDES an occurrence of the verb can move it out of
    this project — a ``cd`` after the verb cannot change where the verb already
    acted, and honouring one turned every gate in this repo off (#326). Where
    several ``cd``s precede an occurrence the last one wins, as in the shell:
    ``cd /a && cd /b && <verb>`` runs in ``/b``.

    A ``cd`` only counts when ``&&`` is the ONLY thing between it and the verb.
    That is what makes the descoping provable: ``&&`` runs the verb only if the
    ``cd`` succeeded, whereas ``cd /elsewhere ; <verb>`` runs the verb HERE the
    moment the ``cd`` fails — and whether it fails is not knowable from the
    command text. It must also be a ``cd`` the shell would really execute, and
    one whose subshell the verb is still inside; see ``_shell_scan``.

    Returns True (gate the command) unless EVERY occurrence of the verb is
    provably somewhere else; a command that touches this project at all must
    be gated. Every failure to establish scope — no CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, an
    unresolvable path, a verb this function cannot find — also returns True,
    because False here means the hook exits 0 without a decision, which the
    PreToolUse contract reads as ALLOW.
