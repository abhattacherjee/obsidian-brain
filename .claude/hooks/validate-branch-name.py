def _targets_this_project(cmd: str, verb: str) -> bool:
    """Check if the command targets a repo within this project.

    Hooks run in their own process (cwd = project dir), so the git state the
    hook inspects is the wrong repo's when Claude does 'cd /other/repo && ...'.
    Parse the cd targets from the command to determine the effective repo.

    ``verb`` is the regex the caller already matched to decide this command is
    worth gating. Only a ``cd`` that PRECEDES an occurrence of that verb can
    move it out of this project — a ``cd`` after the verb cannot change where
    the verb already acted, and honouring one turned every gate in this repo
    off (#326). Where several ``cd``s precede an occurrence the last one wins,
    as in the shell: ``cd /a && cd /b && <verb>`` runs in ``/b``.

    A ``cd`` only counts when ``&&`` is the ONLY thing between it and the verb.
    That is what makes the descoping provable: ``&&`` runs the verb only if the
    ``cd`` succeeded, whereas ``cd /elsewhere ; <verb>`` runs the verb HERE the
    moment the ``cd`` fails — and whether it fails is not knowable from the
    command text.

    Returns True (gate the command) unless EVERY occurrence of the verb is
    provably somewhere else; a command that touches this project at all must
    be gated. Every failure to establish scope — no CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, an
    unresolvable path, a verb this function cannot find — also returns True,
    because False here means the hook exits 0 without a decision, which the
    PreToolUse contract reads as ALLOW.

    Exit 0 with ``permissionDecision: "deny"`` is what BLOCKS, but ONLY if the
    JSON actually reached stdout. Exit 0 with nothing on stdout is an ALLOW, so
    an unwritable decision channel silently turns this gate off. Measured with
    fd 1 closed: all five hooks exited 0 with zero bytes on stdout and zero on
    stderr — no traceback, no warning, command permitted.

    Two mechanics make that reachable rather than theoretical:

    * ``print()`` is a documented NO-OP when ``sys.stdout`` is ``None``, which
      is what CPython sets it to when fd 1 is closed. It does not raise.
    * ``print()`` BUFFERS. Against a pipe whose reader has gone away, the write
      lands at interpreter shutdown — after ``sys.exit(0)`` has already fixed
      the exit code — where ``BrokenPipeError`` is reported as "Exception
      ignored" and changes nothing. Hence the explicit ``flush()`` INSIDE the
      try: it drags that failure back to a point where it can still be acted
      on.

    The fallback is exit 2, the one blocking signal that needs no stdout —
    with ``sys.stdout`` dropped first, or CPython's finalization re-flush fails
    and overrides the status with 120 (measured), which is non-blocking. The
    reason goes to stderr via ``sys.stderr.write`` guarded on truthiness, NOT
    ``print(..., file=sys.stderr)`` — with fd 2 closed ``sys.stderr`` is
    ``None`` and ``print(file=None)`` falls back to STDOUT, which would put a
    non-JSON line on the decision channel.

def _read_hook_input(what):

    ``read(_STDIN_CAP + 1)`` makes an oversize payload an explicit condition
    rather than a silent truncation that only ever surfaces as a confusing
    parse error (note_writer's overflow-detection idiom, extended here to the
    .claude/hooks/ gates). Everything that can go wrong denies, because a gate
    that cannot read its input has not established that the command is safe —
    and every uncaught alternative is fail-OPEN, since an exception exits
    non-zero and a non-zero exit is a NON-blocking error under the PreToolUse
    contract.

    Four failure modes, each measured against these scripts:

    * the READ itself, caught as broadly as the parse. Invalid UTF-8 raises
      ``UnicodeDecodeError`` before ``json.loads`` is ever reached, so the
      read has to be inside a ``try`` at all — but a narrow
      ``(UnicodeDecodeError, OSError)`` is not enough either: with fd 0
      closed, CPython sets ``sys.stdin`` to ``None``, so the failure is an
      ``AttributeError`` on the attribute access and never reaches ``read()``,
      and a closed file object raises ``ValueError``, which is not an
      ``OSError``. Measured: all five hooks exited 1 on ``<&-``.
    * the PARSE. ``json.JSONDecodeError`` is not all ``json.loads`` raises:
      ~400 KB of nested ``[`` — comfortably under the cap — raises
      ``RecursionError``, which is not a ``ValueError``. Hence bare
      ``except Exception``.
    * the SHAPE. ``null``, ``[]``, ``5``, ``"5"`` and ``true`` all parse
      cleanly and then blow up on ``.get()`` in the caller.
    * the NESTED shape. See ``_payload_shape_ok``.

    The guarantee has a floor, and it is the interpreter, not this function:
    fail-closed holds from the hook's first statement onward. Hand the process
    a DIRECTORY as stdin and CPython aborts in ``init_sys_streams`` ("<stdin>
    is a directory, cannot continue") before any of this code runs — exit 1,
    which is non-blocking, and nothing in the script can intervene.
