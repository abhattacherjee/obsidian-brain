# --- BEGIN shared command scanner v1 (keep in sync across all hook copies) ---
# Parses a Bash command into per-statement argv lists so hooks match on real
# command tokens instead of substring-scanning the whole string (issue #43).
# Heredoc bodies are stripped (unless the heredoc feeds a shell RUNNER, where
# the body is the program), and a quoted body survives the tokenizer
# (_split_posix) as a SINGLE token, so neither can masquerade as a command.
#
# Matching is deliberately position-tolerant: the verb is sought as a
# contiguous token run ANYWHERE in a statement, so wrappers and control words
# (`sudo git push`, `xargs git push`, `if ...; then git push ...; fi`) still
# match. For `git` the run may additionally be interrupted by git's own global
# options, so `git -C . push origin main` still resolves to `git push`. Quoted
# text cannot false-positive because it is one token, so the permissive
# position costs nothing and keeps the guard fail-closed.
#
# Executed CODE — not data — is scanned recursively:
#   * a shell runner's `-c` payload, with the runner at ANY argv position
#     (`env bash -c ...`, `sudo bash -c ...`) and the flag in any bundled form
#     (`-c`, `-lc`, `-ec`);
#   * `eval`'s arguments;
#   * the body of every `$( ... )` and backtick command substitution, taken
#     from the heredoc-stripped text PLUS the body of every heredoc whose
#     delimiter was UNQUOTED (`<<EOF`), because bash still expands `$( ... )`
#     there. A quoted delimiter (`<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"`, `<<\EOF`) suppresses
#     expansion, so those bodies stay excluded;
#   * the body of a heredoc fed to a shell RUNNER (`bash <<EOF`, `sh -s <<EOF`,
#     `cat <<EOF | bash`), which is a script rather than data — and is
#     therefore scanned whether or not the delimiter was quoted.
# Recursion is capped at _MAX_SCAN_DEPTH levels of nesting to bound work on
# adversarial input: a payload nested deeper than that is still emitted as an
# opaque token but is not parsed further. Three levels covers every realistic
# wrapper stack (`sudo bash -c "eval ..."` is only two).
#
# ACCEPTED LIMIT: executed code nested 4+ levels deep — `$($($($(cmd))))` or
# four stacked `bash -c` payloads — is NOT parsed, so a verb hidden that deep
# is not matched. This is adversarial-only: no legitimate workflow nests that
# far, and removing the cap makes work grow with attacker-controlled nesting
# depth. See specs/043-parse-dont-grep-hook-commands.md. One partial
# exception: an unparsed `$( ... )` left in COMMAND position with the verb as
# a whole word inside it is reported as a possible verb by _may_hide_verb, so
# `$($($($(git push origin main))))` does match, fail-closed.
#
# Fail-closed contract: _scan_commands raises ValueError when it cannot parse
# reliably (unbalanced quotes, an unterminated substitution). Callers MUST
# catch that and DENY (_UNPARSEABLE_REASON) whenever the raw text names
# their verb or could build it (_deny_unparseable). An unterminated heredoc is NOT a
# failure: bash reads its body to the end of the input, and so does this.
# Comments are removed first (_blank_comments), so an apostrophe in one is not
# a failure; a quote left open outside a comment is.
#
# Duplicated rather than imported: hook templates must be self-contained
# (see CLAUDE.md), matching the existing _targets_this_project() precedent.
# tests/hooks/test_scanner_sync.py enforces byte-identity across all copies.

def _comment_cut(line, state):

    *state* is a dict carried from line to line: ``quote`` (None, ``'``,
    ``"`` or ``$'``), ``stack`` (the open ``$(``, ``$((``, ``${`` and
    backtick contexts, innermost last, each ``[kind, saved_quote, depth]``)
    and ``word_start``.

    A `#` starts a comment where bash says so, measured with bash 5 and zsh
    5.9: unquoted, at the start of a word (after a line start, a blank or one
    of ``;&|()<>``), at the top level or inside ``$( )``. It is text inside
    ``${ }`` and ``$(( ))``, and in the middle of a word (``a#b``, ``$#``,
    ``a\\ #b``). It is also text inside ``(( ))``, ``$(( ))`` and ``$[ ]``,
    where a `<<` is a shift and not a heredoc. A `((` that a `)` at depth 0
    closes on the same line is two subshells (_closes_arithmetic).

    A `((` whose line ends before bash can tell is "unsure": arithmetic if
    a later `))` closes it, subshells if a later `)` does. A `<<` in it
    opens no heredoc, which is right for arithmetic and safe for subshells.

    A `#` word inside arithmetic (``((``, ``$((``, ``$[`` or an unsure
    ``((``) is never a comment there, and bash still runs the `$( )` and
    backticks after it before it fails on the `#`. In an unsure ``((`` it
    may be a comment instead, whose quotes bash ignores. No single reading
    is safe, and real arithmetic never has one, so the line is flagged
    (``state["arith_hash"]``) and _blank_comments refuses to parse the
    command. Inside backticks bash finds
    the closing backtick first and parses the text inside later, on its own,
    with its quotes. So this pass removes nothing there: a `#` that looks
    like a comment may be quoted text, and cutting it could hide a command.
    The scan of each substitution body (_substitution_bodies, then
    _scan_commands, then _blank_comments) removes the comments in it.

    *mask* flags escaped characters and the characters inside quotes,
    backticks, ``${ }`` and arithmetic and inside the removed comment, so a
    `<<EOF` there is not taken for a heredoc.

    Heredoc BODIES are dropped, keeping the opener and terminator lines. Lexer
    state (_comment_cut) is carried from one shell line to the next, so a
    `<<WORD` inside a multi-line quoted string, a comment or arithmetic
    (`$((1<<true))`) is not mistaken for an opener. Heredoc BODY lines
    are skipped without feeding the quote scanner: they are data, and an
    apostrophe in prose would otherwise desynchronise every later line. The
    terminator line is likewise not fed to the lexer — it is a
    delimiter word, not shell code.

    *heredocs* is one ``(opener_line, quoted_delim, body, terminated)`` tuple
    per heredoc, in source order, so _scan_commands can decide per heredoc
    what its body is:

    * ``quoted_delim`` is False for `<<EOF`. Such a body is still data as far
      as statements go, but bash DOES perform command substitution in it, so
      `<<EOF` + `$(git push origin main)` really runs the push, and the body
      has to reach substitution extraction. `<<'EOF'`, `<<"EOF"` and `<<\\EOF`
      suppress all expansion, so those bodies are dropped outright.
    * ``opener_line`` lets _scan_commands ask whether the heredoc feeds a shell
      RUNNER (`bash <<EOF`), in which case the body is a program, not data.

    An unterminated heredoc takes the rest of the input as its body, which is
    what bash does (it warns "here-document delimited by end-of-file" and
    runs the command). Raising here used to drop every hook to its substring
    fallback, which looked only for the LITERAL verb -- so appending
    `; cat <<EOF` to a hidden-verb command (#98) or a chained push (#99) took
    it back to ALLOW. The body is still scanned where it is code: a heredoc
    fed to a shell runner, and substitutions in an unquoted-delimiter body.

    length: a 1 MB single-token command took 39 s end to end, the hook

    It mirrors shlex in POSIX mode with whitespace_split=True and no
    commenters, which is what shlex.split configures:

      * whitespace is space, tab, CR and LF; nothing else separates words;
      * outside quotes, `\\x` yields `x`, so backslash-newline is a newline,
        not a line continuation;

      * inside `"..."` a backslash is dropped only before `"` or `\\`;
      * `''` and `""` yield an empty word, and adjacent quoted and unquoted
        runs join into one word;
      * end of input inside quotes raises ValueError("No closing quotation"),
        and right after a backslash ValueError("No escaped character").

    _split_statements_with_depth already glues a substitution into a single
    word -- "Inside `$( ... )` everything is ONE word to bash", as its own
    comment says -- but that gluing did not survive the tokenizer, which
    re-split on the whitespace INSIDE the span. The consequences were not cosmetic:

      * `git -C $(echo <path>) push origin main` tokenised as
        [git, -C, $(echo, <path>), push, ...]. `-C` consumed `$(echo` as its
        value, the scan stopped on the leftover `<path>)` before reaching
        `push`, so _match_span found no verb run at all -- `_find_statements`
        came back EMPTY and the hook exited at the top as "not a push
        command". Measured: `cd /tmp && git -C <this repo> push origin main`
        was ALLOWED with the substitution and DENIED without it.
      * `git push origin $(echo refs/heads/main)` put a fragment, not the
        span, in destination position.

    Reducing the span to one opaque token is the fix, and it is deliberately
    only that: the body is NOT read, and nothing inside it is matched against
    a branch name. Reaching into the body would fight the design the stripping
    exists to protect -- a `cd` inside `$( )` must not re-scope the parent
    shell (issue #43). The body still reaches the scanner by the one route it
    should, _substitution_bodies, which parses it as its own statements.

    Falls back to plain tokenisation when the text already contains the marker
    character, or when a span never closes -- both mean the protection cannot
    be applied faithfully, and guessing a boundary is worse than the old
    behaviour. Unbalanced QUOTES still raise ValueError out of _split_posix,
    with shlex's own messages, which is the fail-closed contract every caller

    A git run's command strings (`rebase -x`, `submodule foreach`, see
    _git_command_payloads) are payloads too. The call is made once, at the
    first git word, and reads every git word after it. No runner but `eval`
    and `env -S` ends the search: a runner word can be another program's
    value (`env -u git bash -c ...`, `env -u sh git rebase -x ...`, `env -u
    trap trap ...`), so the search goes on and every payload found is
    returned. `eval` and `env -S` take the rest of the line, which is
    scanned in turn.

    The runner is sought at ANY position, mirroring _match_index's position
    tolerance: requiring argv[0] let `env bash -c ...`, `nohup bash -c ...`
    and `sudo bash -c ...` run entirely unscanned.

    A here-string fed to a shell that reads its program from stdin
    (`bash <<< 'git push origin main'`, `sh -s <<< ...`) is the payload too,
    as a heredoc body is for `bash <<EOF` (see _reads_stdin_script). EVERY
    stdin here-string is returned, one per line: bash feeds the LAST one, so
    `bash <<< 'echo hi' <<< 'git push origin main'` pushes.

    and `git rebase -x 'git push origin main' HEAD~1` pushes from THIS repo
    after each rebased commit. Read as one opaque argument, neither was
    seen by any hook.

    EVERY git word from *index* on adds its options to one running set, and
    every word after the first git word is read against that set. The set
    only grows: an argument that looks like git (`--onto git`, a branch
    `fix/git-hooks`) must not end the options of the real run, so the
    options of every git word seen so far apply to every later word. This
    over-reads (a later `grep` inherits rebase's `-x` from an earlier
    `git rebase` in the same statement), which only denies more. `env -u
    git git ls-remote --upload-pack=...` has two git words, and the first
    is env's value. A git word's
    subcommand is the first word after it that is not a global option
    (`_git_subcommand_table`, the table the verb scan uses). A dashed
    program (`git-rebase`) names its subcommand; written `GIT-REBASE` or
    `Git-rebase` git runs it as plain git, but a case-insensitive file
    system finds the dashed program, so both readings are taken. A
    subcommand that is computed (`git "$S" -x ...`), missing, or behind a
    computed global option fails closed: every runner's options are read.
    Any other subcommand reads none, so `git grep -e rebase -x ...` and a
    commit message that mentions `--exec=...` stay text. A long option
    counts when its name is a prefix of an option, as git's parser accepts
    (`--ex`). While `grep` is the only runner subcommand seen, the value
    words of its value options (`-e '-O...'`, `--max-count 1`) are skipped
    (`_GIT_VALUE_SKIP`); with any other runner subcommand in the set they

    no global options. Such a head is not matched when the command word
    runs nothing (_raw_print_only, which also covers `cp`, `mv`, `rm`):
    `echo GIT push origin main` prints. An exact `git` there is still
    matched, as before.

    A comment word or a redirection word is never a head
    (_inert_positions): `... # git-push` and `... > git-push` run nothing.

    git's verb, the word after `git`, matches in any letter case. git finds
    a builtin by its exact name, but an external program (`git-http-push`,
    `git-remote-https`, `git-subtree`) as a file, which the Mac's file
    system finds in any case: `git HTTP-PUSH` runs git-http-push (#135).
    For the same reason a wrong-case dashed head (`GIT-HTTP-PUSH`) is read
    both ways: as git's main entry, then as that program.

    push origin main`. *tool_env*: the command names a variable git or gh
    reads to run another program (_TOOL_ENV_NAMED_RE); see _read_only_run.

    Built from every statement of *cmd* that does NOT literally contain the
    verb run (a literal run is judged as itself, and counting its letters
    would make `cd $REPO && git push origin feature/x` a hidden push). The
    letters of `read P <<< push`, `printf -v C 'git push'`, `for C in ...`,

    PATH WORDS (_is_path_word) add no letters, so `pytest tests/test_push.py
    -k $K` is not a hidden push. Their letters still count where a path can
    become a command: in a statement inside `$( )` (its output becomes
    words), and in the whole command when it assigns IFS, holds a `${...}`
    with an operator (`${X/\\// }`), or runs a plain `$NAME` as a command
    (`C=$(echo git/push | tr / ' '); $C origin main`). Residual: a path
    value set by `printf -v`, `read` or `for`, split in a substitution and
    handed to a wrapper -- `printf -v X git/push; sudo $(echo $X | tr / ' ')

    THE RULE. A statement is the verb when ANY of these holds (*tail* is the
    verb's words after the command word, joined: `push`, `commit`,
    `checkout`, `prcreate`):

      0. COMPUTED COMMAND WORD. The RAW command word is computed
         (_word_is_computed): `$'\x67\x69\x74' $'\x70\x75\x73\x68'
         origin main` has no letter of the verb. Whatever the letters say,
         the statement is the verb. So is a plain `$NAME` command word when
         any word of the whole command is computed (`X=$'\x67\x69\x74'; $X
         push ...`). A computed word anywhere else is judged by rule 1 only,
         so `docker rm $(docker ps -q)` and `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
         ... EOF)"` are not hidden verbs.
      1. LETTERS. The statement is OPAQUE -- some word, read raw, holds an
         unquoted `$`, a backtick, an unquoted `*`, `?` or `[`, or a quote
         glued to a letter outside it, or the command word holds a `$` inside
         double quotes -- and the LETTERS VIEW of the WHOLE COMMAND contains
         *tail* (*spelled*, from _command_spells_verb). The letters view is
         the ASCII letters of every word, joined with no separator, where:
           * parameter names are dropped (`${IFS}` and `$GIT` give nothing,
             `${x:-push}` gives `push`, `$(echo git)` gives `echogit`);
           * a glob word that matches a verb word (`pus?`, `gi[t]`) gives that
             word; a glob of wildcards alone gives nothing;
           * a brace group gives its letters (see _neutralise_brace_expansion);
           * statements that literally hold the verb are left out.
         The STRICT view also drops the arguments of a print-only head
         (_NON_EXECUTING_HEADS) and every quoted multi-word word; it applies
         to every opaque statement. The FULL view drops nothing; it applies
         only when what the statement runs is unknown (_statement_letters),
         because then a quoted value elsewhere -- `C="git push"`,
         `read -r C <<< "git push"` -- may be the very command it runs.
      2. SLOT. A literal command word (`git`, `/usr/bin/git`) is followed, in
         a verb slot, by a token that carries an expansion: `git $g origin
         main` where `g` was set outside this command, so no letter of the
         verb is present to find.
      3. QUOTED COMMAND WORD. A token that still carries an expansion after
         quote removal has every later verb word as a whole word in it or
         after it: `"$GIT" push origin main`. Its `$` is quoted, so rule 1
         does not see it, but bash runs the push.

    None of the rules applies to a read-only `git`/`gh` run (_read_only_run):
    `git log $BASE..HEAD -- src/checkout.ts` is not a checkout.

    Rules 2 and 3 apply at every position (like the literal matcher), except
    after a print-only head, and past position 0 when the head is the
    command word itself. Rule 3 also skips a token holding whitespace past
    position 0: it was quoted, so it is one argument.

    *tail* rather than the full verb (`gitpush`) is deliberate: parameter
    names are dropped, so `$GIT push origin main` has no `git` letters at
    all. Accepted false positives, signed off: an opaque statement that
    contains the verb's letters anywhere -- `docker push $IMG`,
    `make push TAG=$V`, `npm run push -- $X`, `$PAGER push`, and
    `"$ROOT/scripts/commit-preflight.sh"` for the commit gate.

    CEILING, not closed by this: a value built at run time and handed to
    another parser -- `eval "$cmd"`, `echo "$cmd" | bash`, `trap "$cmd" EXIT`
    -- aliases or functions defined in an EARLIER command, and a wrapper
    whose arguments are ALL computed, with no letter of the verb:
    `sudo $(printf git) $(printf pu)$(printf sh) origin main`,
    `sudo $'\x67\x69\x74' $'\x70\x75\x73\x68' origin main`.

    2. Only when NOTHING else in the command may move the shell or hide a
       move: no other `cd` / `pushd` / `popd` word in any scanned statement
       (nested payloads, `eval`, `$( )`, backticks and heredoc runners
       included), nothing _may_move_shell flags (see its docstring), no
       function definition and no BASH_FUNC_ text. Otherwise rule 1 does not
       apply.
    2a. Every run of *verb* is a TOP-LEVEL statement. A run inside a shell
       payload, eval, heredoc fed to a shell, or `$( )` / backtick body may
       follow startup code this reader cannot see (BASH_ENV, an exported
       function, an rc file, zsh's .zshenv even for `zsh -c`). Otherwise
       the answer is _SCOPE_UNKNOWN.
    3. Not the exact shape, but any of those present: _SCOPE_UNKNOWN, so the
       guard runs against this repo (the push guard denies).
    4. None of them anywhere: None.
    5. A command of the rule 1 shape that ENDS in a plain `&& cd -` is
       judged without that tail, once (#156 G-7): the `cd -` runs after
       every other statement, so it moves none of them. Only a path answer
       is taken from the shorter command; anything else is read from the
       whole command.

    Legitimate multi-`cd` shapes (`cd /a && npm ci && cd /a && git push`,
    `cd sub && git push`) are unknown now; that cost was accepted. A file
    the command sources, or a script it runs, may change directory too; that
    is outside the command text and not read.

    *verb* is the run rule 2a checks; with none, any nested statement
    counts. Propagates ValueError from the scanner.

    One left-to-right pass with a stack, not a rescan per `{`. The previous

    every unmasked `{`, so a run of unclosed braces was quadratic overall:
    2 000 braces took 0.15s, 8 000 took 1.55s, 24 000 took 13.6s. The hook is
    registered with a 10s timeout and a killed hook is a NON-BLOCKING error,
    so `git push origin main #{{{{...` pushed main. That is the same failure
    the regex this replaced had, at 24 KB instead of 500 KB.

    A separator counts at ANY depth, matching bash: `{main,{develop}}` expands
    to `main {develop}`, so the outer group is expandable even though only the
    inner one is nested. That is why a popped group propagates its separator
    flag outward.

    An unquoted blank abandons every open group: it makes the construct a
    group COMMAND, not an expansion. Measured in bash:

        {a\\,b} -> {a,b}          {a b}{c,d} -> {a b} expands only the second

    Without that, `{ git push origin main; echo a,b; }` had its whole group --
    the push with it -- replaced by the sentinel, turning a DENY into ALLOW.
    The mask is consulted for the blank and the separator alike, because bash

def _neutralise_brace_expansion(text, _depth=0):
    """Rewrite each UNQUOTED brace group to `$BRACE` before anything scans.

    Bash expands braces before word splitting, so `git push origin
    {main,develop}` reaches git as `origin main develop`. The damage is done
    upstream of every destination test: `_split_statements_with_depth` treats
    `{` and `}` as statement boundaries, so it SEVERS the command --

        "git push origin {main,develop}"
        -> [("git push origin", 0), ("main,develop", 0)]

    -- and the push statement loses its destination altogether, leaving
    something indistinguishable from a bare `git push origin`. No check
    downstream can recover it, which is why teaching `_dest_hits_protected`
    about `{` does not help: the token never arrives.

    Rewriting to `$BRACE` puts a single word back in destination position and
    reuses the machinery that already exists: `_has_unresolved_expansion`
    denies it, with the message that already tells the user to name the
    branch. Doing it on the RAW text also scopes it correctly for free --
    `mkdir -p a/{x,y} && git push origin feature/x` keeps the brace in a
    different statement, so the push is untouched.

    Only the forms bash actually expands are rewritten. Measured with bash:

        {main,develop} -> main develop      {main} -> {main}
        ma{in,ster}    -> main master       {abc}  -> {abc}
        {a..c}         -> a b c             a{b}c  -> a{b}c
        {{main,develop},x} -> main develop x     {main,{develop}} -> main {develop}
        {a{b,c}d,main}     -> abd acd main       {a\\,b}           -> {a,b}

    so a group needs a comma or a `..` range. A plain `{word}` is a literal
    and is left alone, or every `{x}` branch name would falsely deny.

    QUOTED groups are left alone too, because bash does not expand them:
    `git push origin '{main,develop}'` really does name one branch called
    `{main,develop}`, and `git check-ref-format` accepts that name. This is
    the one place the distinction is still visible -- push tokens have been
    through the tokenizer (_split_posix) by the time any later check sees
    them, and the quotes are gone.
