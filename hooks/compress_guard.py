"""Pure predicate for the /compress Step 3.5 high-confidence match filter.

Kept in its own module so the tuning harness (scripts/tune_compress_rank_gap.py)
and pytest (tests/test_compress_rank_gap.py) can import it directly rather
than shelling out through the SKILL.md embedded block.

MIN_RANK_DELTA is empirically tuned against scripts/compress_rank_gap_corpus.json.
Hard constraint: must be < 4.75 so the issue #45 repro case (top -29.46,
runner-up -24.71) resolves to match: True. See the spec at
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-23-compress-rank-gap-delta-guard-design.md
for the full tuning protocol.
