# Obsidian Brain Setup

Configure the obsidian-brain plugin for first use. This skill validates prerequisites, creates vault folders, installs dashboard templates, writes the config file, and verifies everything works.

**Tools needed:** Bash, Write, Read

## Procedure

Follow these steps exactly. Do not skip steps or reorder them.

### Step 1 — Check for existing installation

Read `~/.claude/obsidian-brain-config.json`:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/obsidian-brain-config.json 2>/dev/null
```

**If the file exists and is valid JSON**, extract `vault_path` and present:

> **Existing obsidian-brain installation detected.**
> - Vault path: `<vault_path from config>`
>
> Would you like to:
> - **upgrade** — add new features (dashboards, nudges) without touching existing config or dashboards
> - **reconfigure** — start fresh (will overwrite config and dashboards)
> - **cancel** — exit setup

If **upgrade**: store `MODE=upgrade`. Store `VAULT_PATH` from the existing config's `vault_path` field. Also extract `sessions_folder` (default `claude-sessions`), `insights_folder` (default `claude-insights`), and `dashboards_folder` (default `claude-dashboards`). Skip to Step 5 (Create vault folders — `mkdir -p` is already safe). In upgrade mode:
- Step 5 (Create vault folders): runs normally (`mkdir -p` is idempotent)
- Step 6 (Install dashboards): only write dashboard files that do NOT already exist (`test -f` before each write)
- Step 7 (Write config): SKIP entirely — preserve existing config
- Step 8 (Verify vault access): runs normally
- Step 9 (Configure claudeception nudge): runs normally (has its own idempotency check)
- Step 10 (Print success message): show upgrade-specific message

If **reconfigure**: store `MODE=reconfigure`. Proceed to Step 2 (Ask for vault path) as normal — full setup flow.

If **cancel**: stop here.

**If the file does not exist or is invalid JSON**: store `MODE=fresh`. Proceed to Step 2 (Ask for vault path) — first-time setup.

### Step 2 — Ask for vault path

Ask the user:

> What is the absolute path to your Obsidian vault? (e.g. `/Users/you/obsidian/my-vault`)

Store the response as `VAULT_PATH`. Strip any trailing slash.

### Step 3 — Validate the vault path

Run:

```bash
test -d "$VAULT_PATH" && test -w "$VAULT_PATH" && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"
```

If FAIL, tell the user the path does not exist or is not writable and ask them to correct it. Repeat until OK.

### Step 4 — Check claude CLI availability

Run:

```bash
which claude && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"
```

If FAIL, warn the user:

> The `claude` CLI was not found on PATH. Hook-based AI summarization will not work until it is installed. You can continue setup, but session notes will be raw (unsummarized) until `claude` is available.

Continue regardless — this is a warning, not a blocker.

### Step 5 — Create vault folders

Run:

```bash
mkdir -p "$VAULT_PATH/claude-sessions" "$VAULT_PATH/claude-insights" "$VAULT_PATH/claude-dashboards"
```

### Step 6 — Install dashboard templates

For each dashboard file below, check if it already exists before writing:

```bash
test -f "$VAULT_PATH/claude-dashboards/<filename>" && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"
```

If EXISTS and `MODE=upgrade`, skip this file — preserve user customizations.
Otherwise (MISSING, or `MODE=fresh`, or `MODE=reconfigure`), write the file using the Write tool.

**Important:** The backslash before the triple backticks above is an escape for this document only. When writing the actual files, use plain triple backticks (no backslash).

### Step 7 — Write config file

**If `MODE=upgrade`:** Skip this step — preserve existing config.

**If `MODE=fresh` or `MODE=reconfigure`:**

Write `~/.claude/obsidian-brain-config.json` with this exact structure:

```json
{
  "vault_path": "<VAULT_PATH value from Step 2>",
  "sessions_folder": "claude-sessions",
  "insights_folder": "claude-insights",
  "dashboards_folder": "claude-dashboards",
  "min_messages": 3,
  "min_duration_minutes": 2,
  "summary_model": "haiku",
  "auto_log_enabled": true,
  "snapshot_on_compact": true,
  "snapshot_on_clear": true
}
```

Replace `<VAULT_PATH value from Step 2>` with the actual vault path. Ensure the file is valid JSON.

First run `mkdir -p ~/.claude` to ensure the directory exists.

### Step 8 — Verify vault access

Run:

```bash
TESTFILE="$VAULT_PATH/claude-sessions/.obsidian-brain-test-$$"
echo "test" > "$TESTFILE" && test -f "$TESTFILE" && rm "$TESTFILE" && echo "OK" || echo "FAIL"
```

If FAIL, warn that vault writes are not working and ask the user to check permissions.

### Step 9 — Configure claudeception nudge (idempotent)

Check if the claudeception-to-compress nudge is already configured:

```bash
grep -q "Run ./compress. to save it to your Obsidian vault" ~/.claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"
```

If EXISTS, skip this step — the nudge is already configured.

If MISSING, invoke `/hookify` with this instruction:

> Create a rule: After claudeception finishes and produces output (skill creation or knowledge extraction), display a non-blocking nudge message: "Claudeception extracted knowledge from this session. Run `/compress` to save it to your Obsidian vault." The trigger should match the `Result: PASS` marker or skill file path output from claudeception.

This is a soft nudge — a suggestion, not automatic execution.

### Step 10 — Print success message

**If `MODE=upgrade`:**

> **Obsidian Brain upgraded!**
>
> - Vault path: `<VAULT_PATH>` (unchanged)
> - Config: preserved (unchanged)
> - New dashboards: installed (existing dashboards preserved)
> - Claudeception nudge: configured
>
> Re-run `/obsidian-setup` anytime to pick up new features.

**If `MODE=fresh` or `MODE=reconfigure`:**

> **Obsidian Brain setup complete!**
>
> - Vault path: `<VAULT_PATH>`
> - Config written to: `~/.claude/obsidian-brain-config.json`
> - Folders created: `claude-sessions/`, `claude-insights/`, `claude-dashboards/`
> - Dashboards installed: `sessions-overview.md`, `project-index.md`, `weekly-review.md`, `learning-velocity.md`, `decision-timeline.md`
> - Claudeception nudge: configured (run `/compress` reminder after knowledge extraction)
>
> **Next step — install the Dataview plugin in Obsidian:**
> 1. Open Obsidian Settings > Community Plugins > Browse
> 2. Search for "Dataview" and install it
> 3. Enable the plugin, then go to Dataview settings and turn on:
>    - **Enable JavaScript Queries**
>    - **Enable Inline Queries**
> 4. The dashboards in `claude-dashboards/` will start rendering automatically
>
> Hooks are already registered via `hooks.json` — session logging will begin on your next Claude Code session.
