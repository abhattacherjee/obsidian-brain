# Vault Search

Search the entire Obsidian vault by keyword, tag, or structured field query. Returns ranked results with snippets from both `claude-sessions/` and `claude-insights/` folders.

**Tools needed:** Grep, Read, Bash

## Procedure

Follow these steps exactly. Do not skip steps or reorder them.

### Step 1 — Load config

Run:

```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
python3 -c '
import sys, os
import glob; sys.path.insert(0, max(glob.glob(os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/obsidian-brain/*/hooks")), default="hooks"))
from obsidian_utils import load_config
c = load_config()
if not c.get("vault_path"):
    print("ERROR: vault_path not configured", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
print("VAULT=" + c["vault_path"] + " SESS=" + c.get("sessions_folder", "claude-sessions") + " INS=" + c.get("insights_folder", "claude-insights"))
'
```

Parse the output line to extract `VAULT_PATH`, `SESSIONS_FOLDER`, and `INSIGHTS_FOLDER`.

If the file does not exist, tell the user:

> Config not found. Run `/obsidian-setup` first to configure your vault path.

Stop here if config is missing.

Construct the two search directories:

- `SESSIONS_DIR` = `<vault_path>/<sessions_folder>`
- `INSIGHTS_DIR` = `<vault_path>/<insights_folder>`

### Step 2 — Parse the query

The user provides a query after `/vault-search`. Determine the search mode:

**Tag mode** — query starts with `#` (e.g. `#claude/topic/auth`):
- Strip the leading `#`
- The search target is frontmatter `tags` fields
- Pattern: the tag string as a literal grep pattern
- Search only within the first 30 lines of each file (frontmatter region)

**Structured mode** — query contains `key:value` pairs (e.g. `project:api-service type:decision`):
- Parse each `key:value` pair
- Each pair maps to a frontmatter field grep: pattern `^key:.*value` (case-insensitive)
- All pairs must match in the same file (intersection)

**Keyword mode** — everything else (e.g. `jwt refresh`):
- Treat the entire query as a content search
- Grep for the full phrase first; if zero results, grep for each word individually and intersect

### Step 3 — Try FTS search (fast path)

Before falling back to Grep, try the vault index:

```bash
python3 -c '
import sys, os, json, glob
sys.path.insert(0, max(glob.glob(os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/obsidian-brain/*/hooks")), default="hooks"))
from vault_index import search_vault
results = search_vault(
    os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/obsidian-brain-vault.db"),
    sys.argv[1],
    project=sys.argv[2] if len(sys.argv) > 2 and sys.argv[2] != "None" else None,
    limit=20,
)
print(json.dumps(results))
' "$QUERY" "$PROJECT"
```

If the output is a non-empty JSON array: parse and present results (path, title, type, date, excerpt) using the format in Step 6. Skip Steps 4 and 5 below.

If the output is `[]` or the command fails: print a note that the vault index returned no results, then fall through to Step 4. If the command failed because the DB does not exist, also suggest running `/vault-reindex` to build the index.

### Step 4 — Search both folders in parallel

Use the Grep tool (never Bash grep) for all searching. Launch searches across both `SESSIONS_DIR` and `INSIGHTS_DIR` in parallel.

**For tag mode:**
Run two parallel Grep calls:
- `Grep(pattern="<tag>", path=SESSIONS_DIR, glob="*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches")`
- `Grep(pattern="<tag>", path=INSIGHTS_DIR, glob="*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches")`

**For structured mode:**
For each `key:value` pair, run two parallel Grep calls (one per folder):
- `Grep(pattern="^<key>:.*<value>", path=<folder>, glob="*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches", -i=true)`

Then intersect results across all pairs — only files matching every pair are kept.

**For keyword mode:**
Run two parallel Grep calls:
- `Grep(pattern="<query>", path=SESSIONS_DIR, glob="*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches", -i=true)`
- `Grep(pattern="<query>", path=INSIGHTS_DIR, glob="*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches", -i=true)`

If zero results and query has multiple words, retry by grepping each word separately and intersecting the file lists.

### Step 5 — Extract metadata from matches

For each matched file (up to 20 files), use Read to read the first 40 lines. Extract from frontmatter:

- **date** — the `date:` field
- **type** — the `type:` field (e.g. `claude-session`, `claude-insight`, `claude-decision`, `claude-error-fix`)
- **project** — the `project:` field
- **title** — the first `# ` heading, or the filename without extension

Also extract a **snippet**: the first 200 characters of content after the frontmatter closing `---`.

If there are more than 20 matched files, sort by filename (which contains the date in YYYY-MM-DD format) descending and take only the 20 most recent.

**Performance note:** If there are 10 or fewer matches, read all files in parallel. If there are 11-20, read in two parallel batches.

### Step 6 — Sort and present results

Sort results by date descending (most recent first). Present in this format:

```
Found <N> notes matching "<query>":

1. <icon> <title> (<type-label>, <date>)
   "<snippet>..."

2. <icon> <title> (<type-label>, <date>)
   "<snippet>..."
```

Use these icons for type labels:
- `claude-session` → session
- `claude-insight` → insight
- `claude-decision` → decision
- `claude-error-fix` → error-fix
- anything else → note

Truncate snippets at 200 characters, ending with `...` if truncated.

After the list, tell the user:

> Pick a number to load the full note, or refine your search.

### Step 7 — Handle user selection

If the user picks a number, read the full content of that file using the Read tool and present it in the conversation.

If the user provides a new query, go back to Step 2.
