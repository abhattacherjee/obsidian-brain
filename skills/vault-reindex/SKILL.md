description: Rebuild the SQLite FTS5 vault index. Non-destructive by default — preserves Friston activation data (access_log, themes, theme_members); only regenerates derivable tables. Opt into `--full` for a complete wipe.

# Vault Reindex — Rebuild FTS5 Index

Regenerates the `notes` and `notes_fts` tables from on-disk state. Use when the index is stale, corrupt, after bulk edits in Obsidian, or to purge leftover rows from pytest fixtures.

**Tools needed:** Bash

## Modes

- **Default (`/vault-reindex`)** — non-destructive. Clears and rebuilds `notes`, `notes_fts`, and `term_df` from disk. **Preserves** `access_log` (ACT-R activation history), `themes`, and `theme_members` (cluster centroids + surprise scores). Orphaned rows referencing note paths that no longer exist are pruned.
- **`/vault-reindex --full`** — destructive. Deletes the entire `~/.claude/obsidian-brain-vault.db` file and rebuilds from an empty schema. Every Friston field is lost. Only needed when the schema is corrupt or incompatible.

## Procedure

Follow these steps exactly. Do not skip steps or reorder them.

### Step 1 — Parse arguments and load config

If the user passes `--full`, set `FULL_MODE=true`; otherwise `FULL_MODE=false`.

Run:

```bash
python3 -c '
import sys, os, glob
sys.path.insert(0, max(glob.glob(os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/obsidian-brain/*/hooks")), default="hooks"))
from obsidian_utils import load_config
c = load_config()
if not c.get("vault_path"):
    print("ERROR: vault_path not configured", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(1)
print("VAULT=" + c["vault_path"])
print("SESS=" + c.get("sessions_folder", "claude-sessions"))
print("INS=" + c.get("insights_folder", "claude-insights"))
'
```

Parse each output line as KEY=VALUE, splitting on the first `=`.

If config is missing or the command fails, tell the user:

> Config not found. Run `/obsidian-setup` first to configure your vault path.

Stop here if config is missing.

### Step 2 — Confirm full mode (only if `--full`)

If `FULL_MODE=true`, warn the user before proceeding:

> ⚠️ **Full rebuild requested.** This will **delete** `access_log`, `themes`, and `theme_members` (activation history, cluster centroids, surprise scores). These tables do not regenerate automatically — activation signal accumulates over time as you run `/recall`, `/vault-search`, and `/vault-ask`. Themes will be empty until `/consolidate` ships.
>
> Continue? Reply `yes` to confirm, anything else to cancel.

Wait for confirmation. Abort if the user does not reply `yes`. If cancelled, tell them they can run the default `/vault-reindex` (without `--full`) for a non-destructive rebuild.

### Step 3 — Rebuild

Run, passing the config values and `FULL_MODE` as command-line arguments:

```bash
python3 -c '
import sys, os, glob, time, json
sys.path.insert(0, max(glob.glob(os.path.expanduser("~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/obsidian-brain/*/hooks")), default="hooks"))
from vault_index import rebuild_index
t0 = time.time()
full = sys.argv[4].lower() == "true"
stats = rebuild_index(sys.argv[1], [sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3]], full=full)
stats["elapsed"] = round(time.time() - t0, 1)
stats["mode"] = "full" if full else "preserve"
print(json.dumps(stats))
' "$VAULT_PATH" "$SESSIONS_FOLDER" "$INSIGHTS_FOLDER" "$FULL_MODE"
```

If the command fails (non-zero exit or exception in output), tell the user:

> Index rebuild failed. Check that the vault path is accessible and that the plugin is installed. Error: `<stderr>`

Stop here on failure.

### Step 4 — Report

Parse the JSON output from Step 3. Extract:

- `inserted` — total notes indexed
- `skipped` — files without valid frontmatter
- `elapsed` — time in seconds
- `by_type` — dict mapping note type to count
- `mode` — `"preserve"` or `"full"`
- `preserved` — dict with `access_log`, `themes`, `theme_members` counts (non-destructive mode only)
- `pruned_orphans` — dict with `access_log`, `theme_members` pruned counts (non-destructive mode only)

Present this report:

> **Rebuilt vault index** (`<mode>` mode): `<inserted>` notes indexed in `<elapsed>`s
>
> | Type | Count |
> |------|-------|
> | claude-session | `<count>` |
> | claude-insight | `<count>` |
> | ... | ... |
>
> Skipped: `<skipped>` file(s) without frontmatter.

Only include rows in the table for types that appear in `by_type` (omit zero-count types). Sort rows by count descending.

**Additional section — non-destructive mode only:**

> **Friston data preserved:**
> - `access_log`: `<access_log>` activation event(s)
> - `themes`: `<themes>` cluster(s)
> - `theme_members`: `<theme_members>` assignment(s)
>
> Pruned `<pruned_access_log>` orphaned access-log row(s) and `<pruned_theme_members>` orphaned theme-member row(s) referencing notes no longer on disk.

If both pruned counts are 0, replace the pruning line with `No orphan rows to prune.`.

**Additional section — full mode only:**

> ⚠️ **Friston data cleared:** `access_log`, `themes`, and `theme_members` are now empty. Activation signal will rebuild as you use the vault.

If `inserted` is 0 and `skipped` is 0, also tell the user:

> No notes found. Verify that `<VAULT>/<SESS>` and `<VAULT>/<INS>` exist and contain markdown files.
